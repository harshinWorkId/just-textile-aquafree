        "Processing Requirements":
          "Cotton fibers contain natural impurities like waxes, oils, and pectins. Effective pretreatment is essential - this includes singeing to remove protruding fibers, desizing to eliminate starch, scouring for impurities, and bleaching for whiteness.",
      },

        "Advanced Step - Mercerizing":
          "We use a Swastik Chainless Merceriser to improve luster, tensile strength, and dye affinity. Mercerized cotton not only looks more refined but also retains dyes more evenly.",

        "Dyeing Approach":
          "Reactive dyes are the most common choice for viscose, delivering bright and deep shades. In certain cases, pigment dyes are used for prints and surface effects. Our dyeing ranges (softflow and jigger) are adapted to ensure controlled liquor ratios to protect the fiber structure.",
